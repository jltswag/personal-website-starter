      <h3><b>A Little About Me!</b></h3>
        <p>My name is JT, and I am a rising senior (woot woot class of '23!) I am from Illinois and currently attend a STEM boarding school. At school, I am involved in various STEM and identity-based clubs, one being Girls Who Code!! I have always had an interest in coding, and have recently begun pursuing software development, first with Android apps and now web applications! I also have a huge interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. In my free time, I love to blast music on Spotify, go on morning runs, and alternate between anime and kdramas. </p>
