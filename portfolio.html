      <h3><b>I have past experience with programming!</b></h3>
        <p>Whether it is software development or object oriented computational work, I have experience from courses and projects that I have done in the past. I have taken a couple CS courses within school and for certification. My favorite so far was when I learned Java to create object oriented programming projects.</p>

        <h3><b>PotatoHead Interactive App</b></h3>
        <p>The user was able to construct a Mr. Potato Head diagram by clicking radio buttons that enabled/disabled his personal features. I programmed this using Java and XML in Android Studio.</p>

        <p>Using SQLite, this application took in user-given preferences on cars to print out information cards and receipts. The buttons utilized the database's four core functions. I programmed this using Java and XML in Android Studio.</p>

        <p>This graphical user interface or GUI utilized OOP concepts to get names ranked in a text file and manipulates them through a hashMap and GUI to produce selection user-chosen results. I programmed this using Java in BlueJ.</p>
